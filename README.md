## 📖 Project Overview  
This **Cloud Governance Simulation Tool** is designed to help **Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs)** understand and visualize how **cloud adoption** can improve efficiency, security, and compliance.  

By simulating various **governance parameters** such as cost, risk, and performance, the tool provides a simplified view of how SMEs can optimize their **cloud infrastructure** for sustainable business growth.  

This project aligns with **UN Sustainable Development Goal 8 (SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth)** by promoting **digital transformation**, improving **productivity**, and **reducing barriers** for small businesses to adopt cloud computing.

---

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Simulate **cloud governance policies** for SMEs.  
- Demonstrate the **impact of cloud adoption** using industry case data.  
- Support **sustainable and inclusive economic growth** (SDG 8).  
- Help SMEs understand **cost, compliance, and performance trade-offs**.

📊 Simulation Logic Overview

The tool uses simplified industry report–based parameters to visualize governance trade-offs:

Parameter	Description	Example
Cost Efficiency	Cloud spending optimization	Low / Medium / High
Compliance Score	Adherence to data regulations	% Value
Performance Index	Infrastructure responsiveness	Scale of 1–10
Risk Level	Overall governance risk	Low / Moderate / Critical
🧠 How It Works

The user selects governance priorities (Cost, Risk, Compliance).

The simulation adjusts charts and metrics dynamically.

The dashboard displays governance performance and improvement insights.

Results show how SMEs can balance growth and compliance effectively.

Would you like me to generate a **dashboard preview image (`demo.png`)** showing the simulated governance metrics (cost, risk, compliance) — to upload to your GitHub repo? It’ll make your README look much more professional.
